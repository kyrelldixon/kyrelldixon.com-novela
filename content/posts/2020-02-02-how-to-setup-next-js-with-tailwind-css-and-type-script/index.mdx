This tutorial will show you how to set up a Next.js app with Tailwind CSS and TypeScript. At the end of the post, I will show you how to
optionally use [Purgecss](https://www.purgecss.com/) to remove unused CSS styles.

## 1. Bootstrap the project with Create Next App

[Create Next App](https://nextjs.org/blog/create-next-app) is the Next.js equivalent of Create React App used to set up the boilerplate
for a Next.js web app. Here we're using it along with [`with-typescript`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-typescript)
from the Next.js example repo to set up TypeScript.

```bash
npx create-next-app next-tailwind-typescript-starter --example with-typescript
cd next-tailwind-typescript-starter
```

## 2. Install Tailwind CSS Dependencies

After getting the majority of the project boilerplate setup, we can start working on installing Tailwind. First, let's install the packages.

```bash
# With Yarn
yarn add -D postcss-preset-env tailwindcss

# With Npm
npm i -D postcss-preset-env tailwindcss
```

You can optionally create a `tailwind.config.js` file by using `npx` to run the Tailwind CLI.

```bash
npx tailwind init
```

## 3. Setup PostCSS Build

After installing Tailwind, you have to set it up to be built with PostCSS. First, create the config file. 

```bash
touch postcss.config.js
```

Then you just need to add Tailwind and the PostCSS Webpack preset to the plugins section.

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    'tailwindcss',
    'postcss-preset-env',
  ],
}

```

The PostCSS plugin system expects plugins to be added as the `string` type. This is different than what the Tailwind docs
recommend, so be sure to check out the Next.js [PostCSS docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/customizing-postcss-config#default-behavior) for more details.

## 4. Add Tailwind to CSS file

That's it for the set up! Now we can focus on getting the CSS into Next.js. First create a `styles` directory
and an `index.css` file.

```bash
mkdir styles; touch styles/index.css
```

Now you can use the `@tailwind` directive to inject the `base`, `components`, and `utilities` styles into the CSS file.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

```

## 5. Import Global CSS

All that's left is to import the `index.css` file into a component so Tailwind can be used throughout the app. You might be tempted to import the file in the `Layout` component,
but you can **only** import stylesheets in the `pages/_app.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}` file.

Since we're using TypeScript, let's create an `app.tsx` file. 

```bash
touch pages/_app.tsx
```

Inside of the `_app.tsx` file, we can create a custom App component that is passed `AppProps` and import
the `index.css` file.

```ts {4}
import React from 'react'
import { AppProps } from 'next/app'

import '../styles/index.css'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}

export default MyApp

```

Now the entire web app has access to the Tailwind CSS classes!

## 6. Optional: Configure Purgecss

There are several things you can do to [minimize the CSS file size](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/controlling-file-size).
One of the easiest ways to minimize the file size is to use Purgecss to remove any unused styles from the final CSS file.

To set up Purgecss, first let's install it.

```bash
# With Yarn
yarn add -D @fullhuman/postcss-purgecss

# With npm
npm i -D @fullhuman/postcss-purgecss
```

Now you can add the plugin and tell it to look for CSS class names in all JavaScript and TypeScript files in the `pages` and `components` directories.
If a class name isn't used is one of these files, then it will remove the respective styles from the CSS file.

```js {4-15}
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    'tailwindcss',
    process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
      ? [
          '@fullhuman/postcss-purgecss',
          {
            content: [
              './pages/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
              './components/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
            ],
            defaultExtractor: content => content.match(/[\w-/:]+(?<!:)/g) || [],
          },
        ]
      : undefined,
    'postcss-preset-env',
  ],
}
```

There is also a check to ensure Purgecss is only added in production. Only adding Purgecss in production helps speed up development by removing
the extra CSS processing.

The final step is to whitelist the `base` and `components` styles so that Purgecss doesn't remove them. Here we can use a comment
to whitelist both sections at the same time.

```css {1,4}
/* purgecss start ignore */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
/* purgecss end ignore */
@tailwind utilities;

```

That's the last of the setup! If you ran into any issues, you can check out the [Github repo](https://github.com/kyrelldixon/next-tailwind-typescript-starter) to view the source code for the final boilerplate.
